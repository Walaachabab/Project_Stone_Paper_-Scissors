A simple yet robust Command Line Interface (CLI) implementation of the classic **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game, developed as part of my C++ learning journey.

## 🚀 Overview
This project focuses on applying core programming concepts and building a clean, modular code structure. The game allows the user to play multiple rounds against the computer, tracks wins/losses/draws, and provides a final summary report.

## 🛠️ Concepts Applied
In this project, I successfully implemented:
* **Enums & Structs**: To manage game types (Stone, Paper, Scissors) and aggregate game results.
* **Modular Programming**: Divided the logic into several specialized functions (Single Responsibility Principle).
* **Input Validation**: Ensuring user inputs are within the expected range (1-10 rounds).
* **Randomness**: Utilizing `srand()` and `rand()` for computer move generation.
* **Advanced Flow Control**: Managing nested logic and game loops.

## 🎮 How to Play
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the number of rounds you wish to play (1 to 10).
3. For each round, choose your move:

   - [1] Stone
   - [2] Paper
   - [3] Scissors
3. View the result for each round and a detailed summary at the end.

This project helped me understand the importance of **Clean Code** and how to effectively pass data between functions using `Structs`. It was a great exercise in logic building and error handling.
